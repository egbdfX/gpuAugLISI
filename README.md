# gpuAugLISI

We have developed a GPU-accelerated augLISI. The CPU version of augLISI is displayed on [augLISI](https://github.com/egbdfX/Intensity-sensitive-IQAs?tab=readme-ov-file#auglisi-auglisipy). Please see our paper in Section [Reference](https://github.com/egbdfX/gpuAugLISI/tree/main#reference) for more information.

## User guidance

**Step 1:**
Make sure GCCcore, CUDA, and CFITSIO are avaiable. If you see a warning saying ```/usr/bin/ld.gold: warning: /apps/system/easybuild/software/GCCcore/11.2.0/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/11.2.0/crtbegin.o: unknown program property type 0xc0010002 in .note.gnu.property section```, you would need to make sure Python is also available.

**Step 2:**
Run the Makefile by ```make```. Note that this Makefile is written for NVIDIA H100. If you are using other GPU, you would need to make sure the CUDA arch is matching.

**Step 3:**
Run the code by ```./sharedlibrary_gpu x.fits y.fits```, where ```x.fits``` and ```y.fits``` are the two input images (FITS files). The two input images should have the same size.

**Step 4:**
The code will output a FITS file named ```output_augLISI.fits```, which is the output augLISI matrix.
